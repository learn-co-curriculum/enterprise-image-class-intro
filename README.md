# Image Classification - Introduction

## Introduction

In this section, we'll use our knowledge of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to further investigate machine learning models that are used to interpret and understand the visual world, i.e. computer vision.

## Neural Networks (A Slight Return)

We have learned about ANNs and how they can be created with `TensorFlow`. We have also seen how to normalize, evaluate, and regularize neural networks.  Further, we have experience applying CNNs to image data. 



## Interpretation

While some of this lesson may seem redundant to what we have previously done with neural networks, this lesson will allow us to
*   review the key concepts of neural networks
*   get a better understanding on how neural networks work
*   visualize what is happening within the neural network



In other words, this lesson will allow us to interpret neural networks in meaningful ways.

## Intermediate Activations

We'll load a saved `Keras` model and then use it to visualize how the neural network itself is viewing the world. We'll do this by looking at the intermediate activations of the model.

Using a saved model is called *transfer learning*, which is the topic of our next lesson.

## Summary


Now that we are data scientists that can build neural network models, we need to "level-up" by becoming data scientists that can interpret neural network models as well. Using neural networks for image classification is a great way to do this.
